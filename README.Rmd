# ral

Data package containing RAL classic colors.

## Example

`ral` is a `data.frame` that contains RAL number, color, name, german name and a description.
```{r}
head(ral)
```

`ral_colors` is a named vector that can be used to quickly retrieve a color from the RAL number.

e.g.

```{r}
ral_colors["RAL9010"]
```

##  Install

Currently `ral` is not available from CRAN and can be installed with the following:

```R
devtools::install_github("edwindj/ral")
```
